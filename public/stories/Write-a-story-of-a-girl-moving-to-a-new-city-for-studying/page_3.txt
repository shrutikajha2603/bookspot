Lily spent the rest of the day exploring the Academy.  She made friends with a girl named Pip who loved to paint fantastical creatures, and a boy named Finn who could juggle flaming torches (safely, of course!).  That evening, as Lily sat by her window, watching the candy floss clouds drift lazily across the sky, she felt a wave of happiness wash over her.  Brightville was even more wonderful than she had ever dreamed.  Although she missed Mr. Whiskers and her cozy home, she knew she was exactly where she was meant to be.  She had new friends, exciting classes to attend, and a whole city of whimsical wonders to explore.  As she drifted off to sleep, she smiled, already anticipating the magical adventures that tomorrow would bring.  The lollipop trees might have been a little bit of Grandpappy's playful exaggeration, but the magic of Brightville was utterly, undeniably, real.
