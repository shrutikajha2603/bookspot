The taxi ride was even more exciting than Lily had imagined! The city whizzed by in a blur of vibrant colours.  Buildings shaped like giant gingerbread houses and towering ice cream cones lined the streets.  Lily gasped when she saw a squirrel wearing a tiny top hat scampering up a lollipop tree.  Grandpappy wasn’t *completely* making things up!  When they arrived at the Academy of Whimsical Wonders, Lily’s jaw dropped.  It was even more magnificent than the pictures in the brochure.  The building shimmered with a thousand different colours, and the air hummed with the sound of happy chatter and the gentle tinkling of tiny bells.  A friendly dorm mother, with hair the colour of cotton candy, greeted her at the door.  “Welcome, Lily!  I’m Mrs. Giggles.  Come on in, let’s get you settled into your room!”  Lily’s new room was small but perfectly charming, with walls painted a sunny yellow and a window that looked out onto a garden filled with bouncing mushrooms.
