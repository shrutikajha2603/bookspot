Lily skipped down the street, her bright pink backpack bouncing against her back.  Today was the day! Today, Lily was moving to the bustling city of Brightville to start her studies at the Academy of Whimsical Wonders.  Brightville was famous for its towering lollipop trees, candy floss clouds, and rivers of chocolate milk – at least, that’s what Lily’s grandpappy had told her.  Grandpappy loved to tell tall tales, but Lily held onto the hope that at least *some* of it was true.  Her suitcase, decorated with sparkly stickers of unicorns and rainbows, was nestled beside her, waiting to be loaded into the sparkly, purple taxi that would take her to her new dormitory.  She waved goodbye to her sleepy cat, Mr. Whiskers, who was perched on the window sill, giving her a slow blink.  “I’ll miss you, Mr. Whiskers!” she called, her voice filled with excitement and a tiny bit of sadness.  She couldn't wait to explore Brightville, but leaving her cozy home was a little bittersweet.
