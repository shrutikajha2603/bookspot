## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

-   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) (v18 or later)
-   [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)
-   A [Google AI Studio API Key](https://makersuite.google.com/)
-   A [Vercel](https://vercel.com) account (for Vercel Blob storage)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/shrutikajha2603/bookspot.git](https://github.com/shrutikajha2603/bookspot.git)
    cd bookspot
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Set up your environment variables:**
    -   Create a new file in the root of your project named `.env.local`.
    -   Add your secret keys to this file. This file is ignored by Git and should not be committed.

    ```ini
    # .env.local

    # Your API key from Google AI Studio
    GOOGLE_GENERATIVE_AI_API_KEY="AI...your-google-key-here"

    # Your Read-Write token from your Vercel Blob store
    BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN="vercel_blob_rw_...your-blob-token-here"
    ```

4.  **Run the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Deployment

This project is optimized for deployment on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/).

1.  **Push your code** to your GitHub repository.

2.  **Import the project** into Vercel from your GitHub repository.

3.  **Configure Environment Variables:**
    -   In your Vercel project settings, navigate to the "Environment Variables" section.
    -   Add the same two variables from your `.env.local` file: `GOOGLE_GENERATIVE_AI_API_KEY` and `BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN`.

4.  **Connect Vercel Blob Storage:**
    -   In your Vercel project settings, navigate to the "Storage" tab.
    -   If you haven't already, create a new Blob store and **connect it** to this project. This ensures the `BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN` is correctly configured for the deployment.

5.  **Deploy!** Vercel will automatically build and deploy your project. Any subsequent pushes to your main branch will trigger a new deployment.
